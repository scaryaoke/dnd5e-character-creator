# dnd5e-character-creator
# This is an interactive program to create your own DnD character. Right now it has some limitations. 
# It lacks equipment and inventory data, it lacks subraces, and it has limited selections of classes and races.
# It also can't update characters when they level up.
# However, it is able to make any level 1 character with the following races: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling; and these classes: Fighter, Ranger, Rogue, Cleric.
# It will generate stats, allow you to assign those stats to different attributes, and generate all related stats (initiative, passive perception, etc).
# It will also generate lists of Character Features and Proficiencies.
